#  **Scheduling Algorithms – A Visual Approach**

Efficient CPU scheduling is essential for seamless multitasking, ensuring optimal CPU utilization by determining which process runs and when. This project, offers an **interactive and dynamic** visualization of various scheduling algorithms to enhance comprehension of execution order, waiting time, and turnaround time.

---

## 🎯 **Why CPU Scheduling?**
CPU scheduling plays a vital role in **maximizing system efficiency and resource utilization**. Different scheduling algorithms impact key performance metrics:
- ⏳ **Waiting Time** – The duration a process remains in the queue before execution.
- ⌛ **Turnaround Time** – The total time from process arrival to its completion.
- ⚡ **Response Time** – The time taken for the first execution after arrival.

Optimized scheduling ensures fair CPU distribution, improves system throughput, and minimizes delays.

---

## 📌 **Implemented Scheduling Algorithms**
- 🏁 **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** – A **non-preemptive** strategy where processes execute in arrival order.
- ⏱ **Shortest Job First (SJF)** – Prioritizes processes with the **shortest burst time** to improve efficiency.
- 🔄 **Round Robin (RR)** – **Time-sliced execution** ensures fairness among processes.
- 🎖 **Priority Scheduling** – Executes processes based on **priority levels** rather than arrival time.
